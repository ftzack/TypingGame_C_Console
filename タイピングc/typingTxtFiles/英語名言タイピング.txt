Two wrongs don't make a right.
Practice makes perfect.
Birds of a feather flock together.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
A bad workman always blames his tools.
A word is enough to the wise.
Time flies like an arrow.
Fortune comes in at the merry gate.
Speech is silver, silence is gold.
A bad wife ruins the house.
After a storm comes a calm.
All is well that ends well.
All good things must come to an end.
Little and often fills the purse.
Time is money.
